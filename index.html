    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>The global shift towards renewable energy sources like solar and wind is essential for combating climate change. However, this transition faces significant challenges:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources creates instability in energy supply.</li>
        <li>There is a critical lack of efficient and scalable energy storage solutions to balance supply and demand.</li>
        <li>Existing battery technologies, particularly those relying on rare earth minerals, pose environmental and supply chain risks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, the electrification of all sectors will exponentially increase electricity demand, further intensifying the need for robust energy storage systems. Current lithium batteries, while prevalent, have notable drawbacks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Risk of explosions due to thermal instability.</li>
        <li>High degradation rates, leading to reduced lifespan and increased maintenance costs.</li>
